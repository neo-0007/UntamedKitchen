    <h2>Farm2Food Foundation</h2>
    <p>Farm2Food Foundation played a vital role in connecting us with a rural community where we explored and identified uncultivated edible plants. Their support enabled us to conduct insightful workshop sessions on-site and deepen our understanding of native plant practices. We are especially grateful to <strong>Ankita Ma'am</strong>, who guided us throughout the process as our coordinator, and to <strong>Partha Sir</strong> for his continuous encouragement and facilitation.</p>

    <h2>Assam Agricultural University (AAU)</h2>
    <p>AAU offered us academic insights and expert guidance, particularly in the fields of nutrition and botanical analysis. Their contributions helped us evaluate the nutritional value of various wild plants and understand their impact on health and sustainability. We sincerely thank the faculty for their time and valuable inputs.</p>
